## SARS-CoV-2 analysis with Maine-focused subsampling
This analysis focuses on SARS-CoV-2 sequences available from Maine with additional sequences from the rest of the USA selected by genetic similarity to the state-level sequences. Additional global context is provided by evenly sampling sequences from major global regions across time.
